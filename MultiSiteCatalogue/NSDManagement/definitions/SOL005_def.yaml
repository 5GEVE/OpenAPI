       This type represents a list of key-value pairs. The order of the pairs in the list is not significant.
       In JSON, a set of key- value pairs is represented as an object. It shall comply with the provisions 
       defined in clause 4 of IETF RFC 7159.

   ProblemDetails:
     #SOL005 location: 4.3.5.3-1
     description: >
       The definition of the general "ProblemDetails" data structure from
       IETF RFC 7807 [19] is reproduced in this structure. Compared to the
       general framework defined in IETF RFC 7807 [19], the "status" and
       "detail" attributes are mandated to be included by the present document,
       to ensure that the response contains additional textual information about
       an error. IETF RFC 7807 [19] foresees extensibility of the
       "ProblemDetails" type. It is possible that particular APIs in the present
       document, or particular implementations, define extensions to define
       additional attributes that provide more information about the error.
       The description column only provides some explanation of the meaning to
       Facilitate understanding of the design. For a full description, see
       IETF RFC 7807 [19].
