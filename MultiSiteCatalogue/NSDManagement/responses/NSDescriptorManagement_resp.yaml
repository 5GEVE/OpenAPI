       Error: The operation cannot be executed currently,
       due to a conflict with the state of the resource.
       Typically, this is due to the fact the NS descriptor
       resource is in the enabled operational state (i.e.
       operationalState = ENABLED) or there are running
       NS instances using the concerned individual NS
       descriptor resource (i.e. usageState = IN_USE).
