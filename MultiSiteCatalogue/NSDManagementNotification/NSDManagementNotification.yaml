    In clause 4.3.2 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 002 v2.4.1, an attribute-based
    filtering mechanism is defined. This mechanism is currently not
    included in the corresponding OpenAPI design for this GS version. Changes
    to the attribute-based filtering mechanism are being considered in v2.5.1
    of this GS for inclusion in the corresponding future ETSI NFV OpenAPI
    design.
